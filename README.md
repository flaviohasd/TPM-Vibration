## Introduction
  Hello, my name is Fl√°vio Dias. I'm a Mechanical Engineer graduated at Federal University of Amazonas (Brazil) and this project was developed for my final paper. The goal is to minimize the amplitude of the vibration signal of a spur gear mesh system (with contact ratio between 1 and 2) by performing a TPM - Tooth Profile Modification (specifically, changing the maximum amount of tip relief -adendum modification-) for a certain working condition.

## Description
  The idea of this post is to contribute with the learners, so they don't waste time doing what others already did and then develop even further. You can reproduce this as long you keep it well referenced.
  
  Please note: the code is writen in MATLAB in PT-BR language (might make an EN version someday) and is structured as follows:
